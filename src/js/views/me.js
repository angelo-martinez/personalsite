						<p>
							I was born in Santa Clara, Cuba and I came to the US at the age of eight full of wonder and
							excitement for my new life in America. I first lived in San Diego, California and then my
							family moved to Miami, Florida where we have remained ever since. Growing up I always had a
							deep fascination with computers and when I finally saved up enough lunch money to build my
							very first gaming PC I was instantly hooked. It was my curiosity for all things tech and my
							desire to challenge myself that convinced me to enroll in a Full-Stack coding boot camp and
							learn to code. Ever since the end of the program I have been working with various companies
							in Miami helping them improve their SEO, webpage performance, and reach more clients through
							organic growth.
